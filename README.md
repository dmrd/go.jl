[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmrd/go.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmrd/go.jl)

This repository implements a Go bot framework end-to-end in Julia, including
functionality to maintain board state, extract features, read SGF files, and
communicate with other Go programs over GTP.

For the moment, bots based on machine learning are implemented using Keras and PyCall.
